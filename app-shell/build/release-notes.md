## Opentrons App Changes in 4.0.0

Opentrons App 4.0.0 comes with an entirely overhauled robot calibration process for the OT-2. With these changes, you'll calibrate less often; the calibration processes are shorter, easier, and more reliable; and you can finally do things like calibrate multiple kinds of tipracks for use in a protocol.

This release is a beta release for the real 4.0.0.
